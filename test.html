            <h4 class = "subtitle"> Industrial Employment in Australia</h4>

            <p class = "text">This chart illustrates employment numbers across various industries in Australia. 
            Up until 2019, retail trade was the largest employer in the country, 
            but healthcare overtook it, becoming Australia's top industry for employment. 
            This change reflects the growing needs of Australia's aging population, 
            as well as improvements in healthcare services and outcomes. The rise in healthcare jobs was further 
            boosted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which significantly increased the demand for healthcare workers. 
            Moreover, technological advancements in the healthcare sector have contributed to this employment growth, 
            positioning healthcare as a key pillar of the Australian workforce.

                <p class = "text">  This choropleth map shows the median weekly income of employees in Australia. 
                The Northern Territory had an overwhelmingly higher median in 1983, 
                and it wasn't until 1993 that other states started to catch up with it. 
                2023 data shows that the Northen Territory still has the highest median weekly
                income in Australia, with New South Wales and Western Australia following closely 
                behind. South Australia and Tasmania are the two states with the lowest
                median weekly income in Australia. </p>

                <p class = "text"> This population chart illustrates that wages for Australians are 
                lowest among those aged 15 to 19, gradually increasing until they reach their peak. 
                For Australian females, the highest earnings occur in the age bracket of 45 to 54, while 
                Australian males hit their peak one age group earlier, at 35 to 44. After reaching these 
                peaks, earnings decline until retirement age, which is defined as 65 and older. </p>

            <h4 class = "subtitle"> World GDP per Capita</h4>

            <p class = "text"> This global choropleth map, filtered by year, highlights that Australia 
                consistently ranks among the top countries in GDP per capita. High-income nations are 
                generally located further from the equator, with notable exceptions like Singapore, which 
                stands out as a regional outlier. Australia's strong GDP per capita is driven by key sectors 
                such as mining, finance, healthcare, and education. These industries have contributed to 
                its robust economic performance over the years, making it a leader in the Asia-Pacific region, 
                with a stable economy that continues to attract global investments. </p>
